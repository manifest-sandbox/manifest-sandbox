# Governance

## Project Maintainers

[Project maintainers](CODEOWNERS) are responsible for all activities maintaining and updating the manifest-sandbox project. Final decisions on the projects reside with the project maintainers.

Maintainers MUST remain active. To remain active they MUST collaborate on the project at least once in a 3 month period. Example collaborations include, attending the community meeting, creation or commenting on issues/PRs, PR reviews, etc. If they are unresponsive for >3 months, they will be automatically moved to emeritus unless a
[super-majority][super-majority] of the other project maintainers agrees to extend the period to be greater than 3 months.

New maintainers can be added to the project by a [super-majority][super-majority] vote of the existing maintainers. A potential maintainer may be nominated by an existing maintainer.

Submissions for new maintainers can be made by creating an [issue][issue]. The current maintainers will be able to cast a single vote each via a +1 comment on the issue. Once a [super-majority][super-majority] has been reached a pull request is made on the repo adding the new maintainer to the [CODEOWNERS](CODEOWNERS) file.

All changes to the main branch require approval by two active maintainers prior to merge.

A maintainer may step down by submitting an [issue][issue] stating their intent and they will be moved to emeritus.

Changes to this governance document require a pull request with approval from a [super-majority][super-majority] of the current maintainers.
